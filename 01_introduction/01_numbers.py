# Exercise 01
# ------------
# 1. Subtract 5 to the 3rd power, which is 53, from 100 and divide the result by 5:

# 2. Add 6 to the remainder of 15 divided 4:

print( (15 % 4)  + 6)

# 3. Add 2 to the 2nd power, which is 22, to the integer division of 24 and 4:


# Number Types: Integers and Floats

# Exercise 2: Integer and Float Types
# ------------
# 1. Begin by explicitly determining the type of 6 using the following code:
print(type(6))

print(type(6.0))
# 3. Now, add 5 to 3.14. Infer the type of their sum:

# 4. Now, convert 7.999999999 to an int:

# 5. Convert 6 to a float:
